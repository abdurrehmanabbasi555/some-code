                           <p>Market research or market research is a continuous research process based on collecting, recording and analyzing information and data about customers, competitors and the market. It helps you prepare feasibility studies and work plans for medium and small projects, and also helps in launching new products, expanding and obtaining suitable financing.</p>
                            
                            <p>When searching and viewing, we were interested in financial indicators and the status of these sectors of projects in the market, and we found that the income or profits and losses list is one of the best indicators that combine ease of presentation and the ability to compare with other projects, and we have been keen to standardize the offering and terminology in all activities to facilitate in the presentation process as well.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                            To warn, this information is important and excellent. However, it gives a general picture of the industry and the field and is not satisfied with it, as it was set as a guide for conducting an appropriate feasibility study process that is compatible with the field.</p>
                            <p>
                            The goal here is not to do a market research to prepare a feasibility study, but a survey of more than 6,000 establishments in a specific field and to study the list of profits and losses over a period of 10 years, and here is the conclusion.</p>
                            <p>
                            Disclaimer: The aim of this information is educational and indicative, and a direct investment decision should not be based on it without entering into study processes for the specific project in which it is intended to be invested. Statistical data:</p>
                            <p>
                            Inventory in this area was approximately 1.3%. Cost of sales is approximately 9%. Gross profit is approximately 91%. The average salary and wages is 5.5%. The rental cost is 4.3%. Foreign contracts 2.7%. Total expenses 75% Net profit 16% How do I benefit from this data:
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                            When studying the feasibility, take into account the percentage of selling costs. When studying the feasibility, take into account the percentage of salaries and wages. When studying the feasibility, take into account the total profit when evaluating the project. Take into account whether the project you studied gives you a profit margin that is better or less than the international indicators. Before deciding to rent in a rental, make sure that the rental is close. When preparing the feasibility study, make sure of the expenses. Also, when evaluating your project, make sure that the project is better or close to the above ratios. When you want to invest and show you some indicators, make sure that they are real and that they are close to global indicators.</p>
